Visualization in Excel Project: Sales Dashboard


Project Overview:


This project focuses on creating a comprehensive Sales Dashboard in Excel, utilizing a dataset with 701 entries and various fields, including:


•	Segment

•	Customer_ID

•	Product_ID

•	Discount Band

•	Units Sold

•	Manufacturing Price

•	Sale Price

•	Gross Sales

•	Discounted Sales

•	Sales ('000)

•	COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)

•	Profit

•	Profit ('000)

•	Date, Month, Quarter, Year

•	Customer Name

•	Product Name

•	Country

I developed a dynamic dashboard using PowerPoint, which I then copied and pasted into my Excel file. The dashboard was designed to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide better insights into sales performance, ultimately helping to drive decision-making and enhance the analysis of sales data

Process & Methodology:

•	Pivot Tables & Charts: I created several pivot tables to summarize the data and then generated charts based on these pivots. These charts were copied into the the interactive dashboard design.

•	Slicers: To increase interactivity, I incorporated slicers and connected them to all the pivot tables.

•	Data Visualization Tools: I used a variety of chart types to visually communicate key trends and performance metrics. These included:

o	Stacked Column Chart: Sales and Profit Percentage by Month

o	Clustered Bar Chart: Sales by Customer

o	Donut Chart: Sales by Country

o	Treemap: Sales Breakdown by Segment

o	Line Graph: Profit Trend Over Months

o	Pie Chart: Units Sold Split by Percentage

o	Sunburst Chart: Sales by Year and by Product

Business Requirements & KPIs: To ensure the dashboard met business objectives, the following key performance indicators (KPIs) were prioritized:

1.	Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.

2.	Profit and Profit Percentage: Understanding profitability and margin efficiency.

3.	Number of Items Sold: Total count of different items sold.

4.	Top Selling Product: The product that generated the highest revenue.

Please feel free to critique my work; doing so will help me get better at future visualization projects.
